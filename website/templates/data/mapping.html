						Analysts and researchers utilize the New York City map properties for a mixture of exploration purposes, members of The Manhattan Project utilized 1902 copies of New York City topography maps from the Map Division as a blueprint to focus the verifiable base geography of Manhattan Island. The examination educated a natural representation of Manhattan Island that would have been in place before Europeans arrived to influence the area. At the point when identified with the venture's other verifiable information, for example, height, slant, hydrography and other information sorts, the Manhattan group had the capacity to sensibly speculate what soils, greenery, fauna and human scene components may have possessed differing sections within the area. Professor Farah Griffin, at Columbia University, led a testimonial for Black ladies craftsmen in New York utilizing the Map Division's residential map zonings of Harlem, spanning from the 1920s to 1940s, to explore regional and social arenas like theaters, lodgings, line houses, and doctor's facilities.

						Fire protection maps typically are the most intensely utilized as they are remarkable for their incredible notation of subtle elements. Fire mapping was conceived in the consequence of the great New York City fire of 1835, which pulverized 20 million dollars worth of property. The flame bankrupted numerous insurance agencies and achieved considerable changes in terms of protected property that was now to be overlooked and cared for. Starting with the most punctual preparations, the organization of the maps has stayed generally steady, only accounting for as littls as 2 x 3 feet of bound area. NYPL's flame protection map gathering is remarkable considering that it contains composition documentations from past managers; including regional, residential, and real estate sectors. These documentations show up as pieces of paper stuck to the maps or as written corrections; regularly they demonstrate various house assignments, indicating when and where assignment occurred. Neighborhood students of history, planners, archeologists and urban organizers are all enthusiastic proponents of these chronicled maps of New York City at the piece and parcel level. They utilize the maps to research the historical backdrop of specific structures and neighborhoods, to elaborate on social history and configuration, along with environmental and manufacturing concerns. The maps illustrate histories of the organizations or homes recorded.
