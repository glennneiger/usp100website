						The borough of Staten Island has a character distinct from the rest of New York City. Compared to the rest of the city, Staten Island is the least racially diverse borough, is more suburban in character, is primarily comprised of homeowners rather than renters, and has a much greater percentage of Republicans relative to the rest of the city. With a 2013 population of 472,621, it is by far the least populous borough in the city. In 1990, a referendum was held for Staten Island voters (with controversy regarding the concept of self-determination of Staten Island, New York City, and New York State after New York State’s overruling New York City’s attempt to block the referendum as an exercise of its right to home rule) [3], who voted to secede from New York City; the movement dissipated after Rudolph Giuliani, who pledged to treat the borough as fairly as the rest of the city, was elected in 1993.
						<br><br>
						In the years following Staten Island’s attempted secession, the borough has been the recipient of an increasingly larger share of New York City development projects and has a notable presence in New York City’s Vision 2020 waterfront plan. Development plans are currently in place for the construction of three large-scale malls in addition to expansion of the Staten Island Mall throughout the borough.[4] The most notable projects contributing to urban development in the borough are those centered on development along the borough’s North Shore, of which the most notable is the St. George Redevelopment Project. The project includes plans for the New York Wheel, a Ferris wheel currently under construction that will become the world’s largest Ferris wheel at 625 feet when it opens in 2017, and Empire Outlets, a 340,000-square-foot complex that will include a mall 200-room, 130,000-square-foot hotel. In total, the two projects are projected to create approximately 1,100 construction jobs and 1,300 permanent jobs. The goals of these projects (as well as other Staten Island waterfront projects) are to boost the local economy (the projects are projected to draw in approximately two million tourists per year) and to establish a more well-defined “downtown Staten Island” area by making better use of an underutilized waterfront area. Both projects are seeking Platinum LEED certification, ensuring that they will be environmentally friendly, and will encourage use of the New York Harbor as a transportation medium.
