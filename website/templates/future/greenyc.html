						In 2007, the Mayor’s Office announced the object to lower New York’s carbon footprint by one third by 2030. New York City is now on track to achieve this object by far. GreeNYC, as a part of PlaNYC program is committed to help New York people make New York City more sustainable. GreeNYC is an initiative to help residents of New York City reduce their energy consumption, choosing a more environmentally sound lifestyle, and taking small actions which helps decrease the city’s carbon footprint and promote the environment.
						<br><br>
						Seven years after the GreeNYC was announced, in September, 2014, according to Mayor de Blasio’s announcement, New York City is committing to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent over 2005 levels by 2050. This plan will impel tremendous number of financial savings and creating thousands of jobs for New Yorkers. It leads New York to a long term investment in renewable energy and a transition from fossil fuels to cleaner source of energy.
						<br><br>
						To realize the sustainability plan, New York City also enacts Greener, Greater Buildings Plan (GGBP), which increases energy efficiency in large existing buildings. GGBP consists of four regulatory pieces, which include:
						<ul>
							<li>Annual requirement to benchmark energy and water consumption.</li>
							<li>New York City’s local energy code.</li>
							<li>nduct an energy audit and perform retro-commissioning once every 10 years.</li>
							<li>By 2025, the lighting in the non-residential space be upgraded to meet code and large commercial tenants be provided with sub-meters.</li>
						</ul>
						According to New York government, “these laws will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by almost five percent, have a net savings of $7 billion, and create roughly 17,800 construction-related jobs over 10 years.”
						<br><br>
						The New York City Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has started to implement a citywide “Green Infrastructure Program” to manage storm water runoff that would discharge into the combined sewer system and contribute to combined sewer overflows. It will save millions of dollars and improve the quality of water for New Yorkers to realize the goal of protecting public health by supplying clean water, treating wastewater and reducing hazardous pollution.

					<h4 id="sec1">Housing</h4>
					<p>
						Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a 10-year plan to build or preserve 200,000 affordable apartments across all five boroughs by releasing Housing New York: A Five-Borough, Ten-Year Plan in May, 2014. This plan will cost $41 billion and it will provide lower class all the way to the middle class with affordable housing in New York.
						<br><br>
						By the end of 2014, the City had financed the building of more than 17,300 affordable units, including 11,185 preserved units and 6,191 new construction units. These preserved and newly constructed units can accommodate about 42,000 New Yorkers. The data below are provided by New York government official.

						New York also has a mandatory inclusionary housing program. It requires a partition of the newly constructed houses developed for the lower-income people. To ensure the effectiveness of mandatory inclusionary housing program, the city government will provide multiple options for meeting the requirements.
						<br><br>
						Moreover, the city government also surveys all vacant sites in New York City. It compels affordable housing on underused sites. This action will tremendously increase the effectiveness of city land use. The deserted areas in New York will develop in multi-utility buildings and also works for the Greener, Greater Buildings Plan.
						<br><br>
						New York government not only help with the lower-income group with inclusionary housing program. In order to promote these community economic diversity, the government initializes a mixed income program which targets 20 percent of low-income households, 30 percent for moderate income households, and 50 percent for middle-income households. The economic stress of lower income group will relieve greatly due to the help of the program. Also, as the essential housing constructions in New York, the middle income housing will have a boost of the economy and real estate industry.
