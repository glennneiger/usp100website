						In 2007, the Mayor’s Office announced the object to lower New York’s carbon footprint by one third by 2030. New York City is now on track to achieve this object by far. GreeNYC, as a part of PlaNYC program is committed to help New York people make New York City more sustainable. GreeNYC is an initiative to help residents of New York City reduce their energy consumption, choosing a more environmentally sound lifestyle, and taking small actions which helps decrease the city’s carbon footprint and promote the environment.
						<br><br>
						Seven years after the GreeNYC was announced, in September, 2014, according to Mayor de Blasio’s announcement, New York City is committing to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent over 2005 levels by 2050. This plan will impel tremendous number of financial savings and creating thousands of jobs for New Yorkers. It leads New York to a long term investment in renewable energy and a transition from fossil fuels to cleaner source of energy.
						<br><br>
						To realize the sustainability plan, New York City also enacts Greener, Greater Buildings Plan (GGBP), which increases energy efficiency in large existing buildings. GGBP consists of four regulatory pieces, which include:
						<ul>
							<li>Annual requirement to benchmark energy and water consumption.</li>
							<li>New York City’s local energy code.</li>
							<li>nduct an energy audit and perform retro-commissioning once every 10 years.</li>
							<li>By 2025, the lighting in the non-residential space be upgraded to meet code and large commercial tenants be provided with sub-meters.</li>
						</ul>
						According to New York government, “these laws will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by almost five percent, have a net savings of $7 billion, and create roughly 17,800 construction-related jobs over 10 years.”
						<br><br>
						The New York City Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has started to implement a citywide “Green Infrastructure Program” to manage storm water runoff that would discharge into the combined sewer system and contribute to combined sewer overflows. It will save millions of dollars and improve the quality of water for New Yorkers to realize the goal of protecting public health by supplying clean water, treating wastewater and reducing hazardous pollution.
