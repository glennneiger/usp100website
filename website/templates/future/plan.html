						The New York City Housing Authority using public housing funds to construct new housing and renovating the old houses. Moreover, the housing authority also put into a lot of funds in helping homeless population to build shelters so that they stay over when it’s raining or snowing. Also, there is a service for the homeless and runaway children to provide these children a foster care. To make sure these children have a place that they belong, especially during Thanksgiving and Christmas time when all the children should be feeling the warmth of family. This service called the Human Resources Administration, they provide financial aid to the homeless people, the administration also provide social services to prevent the homelessness. Since these homeless people are not able to afford public health, the HASA also stand for HRA’s HIV/ AIDS Administration, their job is to provide these homeless a place to check if they had HIV or any diseases that are related to it. There are also many other services in the New York City, some of it is to provide homeless people an alcoholic rehab center so they can stop drinking and start having a goal in their lives.

					<p>
						New York citizens, companies, and the local government received invitation to participate consolidated plan presentation. Everyone who live or work in the city are allow to join the event, and the event will have multiple languages for those people who don’t have English as their first language. This idea not only helping the people to get a better understanding of what the city is planning, but also letting people to know each other better. Also, it provides an equal chance to everyone to be able to have a chance to speak out about what they think of the plan, because sometimes the planners could be wrong and blindly implement some of the plans that could cause troubles inside the city. By inviting everyone, the planners can easily find out where they need to improve and provide residents a better environment to live.

The city comes up with the consolidated plan Five-Year strategic plan which help specifically these types of people by building an area that are full of people with disabilities or people with mental illness and people who are simply not eligible to own a house; a place to live. At the very end of the meeting, there will always be a question and answer time for the organizations to ask some businesses-related questions such as affordable housing. These people want to know how the local government allocate the funds and resources, will these resources be green energy or will it improve the air quality, etc. However, the meeting is mainly about housing for homelessness and disability people.
