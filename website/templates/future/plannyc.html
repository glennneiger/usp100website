					<p>
						By entering the 21st century, New York has undergone a period of economic booming and population surge. There will be more than 9.1 million residents living in New York City by 2030. The planning theme of New York City is transferring: globe warming, a booming population and increasing economic inequality between people of different classes present new challenges in front of the government of New York City for the future.
						<br><br>
						Former Mayor Bloomberg outlined PlaNYC which was a sustainability and resiliency blueprint in order to improve and maintain New York City in April, 2007. It includes the following targets:
						<ul>
							<li>The cleanest air in 50 years.</li>
							<li>865,000 trees and five million square feet of reflective rooftop added to our urban landscape.</li>
							<li>Building codes upgraded to prepare for floods, wind, and extreme weather.</li>
							<li>19% reduction in carbon emissions since 2005, well ahead of our goal to reach 30% reduction by 2030.</li>
						</ul>

						As the plan has proposed, if New York City wants to continue its glory, the city needs to focus on improving the quality of residents’ lives and the increasing the efficiency of the infrastructure.

					<h4 id="sec1">Transportation</h4>
					<p>
						Inner Ring Residential Parking Study is a study which examines the relationship among cost of parking, residents’ choices about vehicles, and zoning requirements for parking conducted by New York government. New York City’s Zoning Resolution requires new residential buildings to provide accessory parking for a percentage of residential units. Each district specifies a minimum requirement, with the highest requirements in lower-density districts and the lowest requirements in higher-density districts.
						<br><br>
						This study emphasizes on a geography identified as “the Inner Ring,” which including neighborhoods in Upper Manhattan, the South Bronx, western Queens, and northern and central Brooklyn. Neighborhoods in the Inner Ring are dense and multi-functional communities close to subway line with lower rates of automobile ownership.
						<br><br>
						Based on the findings of this study, several principles are identified to guide parking policies and to inform future discussion in the decision-making level of New York government:
						<ul>
							<li>Recognize that accessory residential parking facilities in the Inner Ring often provide parking for residents throughout the neighborhood, and are often operated as public parking.</li>
							<li>Evaluate off-street parking requirements on a neighborhood-by-neighborhood basis.</li>
							<li>Update the parking requirements for affordable housing to reflect current programs and vehicle ownership rates.</li>
							<li>Continue to expand the availability of transportation options in the Inner Ring.</li>
						</ul>
						According to Mayor de Blasio’s announcement in September, 2014, New York City is committing to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent over 2005 levels by 2050. This plan will impel tremendous number of financial savings and creating thousands of jobs for New Yorkers. It leads New York to a long term investment in renewable energy and a transition from fossil fuels to cleaner source of energy.
						<br><br>
						To realize the sustainability plan, New York City also enacts Greener, Greater Buildings Plan (GGBP), which increases energy efficiency in large existing buildings. GGBP consists of four regulatory pieces, which include:
						<ul>
							<li>Annual requirement to benchmark energy and water consumption.</li>
							<li>New York City’s local energy code.</li>
							<li>Conduct an energy audit and perform retro-commissioning once every 10 years.</li>
							<li>By 2025, the lighting in the non-residential space be upgraded to meet code and large commercial tenants be provided with sub-meters.</li>
						</ul>
						According to New York government, “these laws will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by almost five percent, have a net savings of $7 billion, and create roughly 17,800 construction-related jobs over 10 years.”
						<br><br>
						The New York City Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has started to implement a citywide “Green Infrastructure Program” to manage storm water runoff that would discharge into the combined sewer system and contribute to combined sewer overflows. It will save millions of dollars and improve the quality of water for New Yorkers to realize the goal of protecting public health by supplying clean water, treating wastewater and reducing hazardous pollution.
