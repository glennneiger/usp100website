					<p>
						New York City has always been known as a hub for vibrant commercialism, innovation, transportation, and its powerful economic capacity. This site takes a comprehensive look at differing sectors of the urban foundation of New York city including factors such as: Transportation, Urban Design, Sanitation, Data Innovation, Different Municipalities, Major projects, Zoning/Housing, and Future plans/Sustainability.

 						City transit has always been a focal point in regard to the formulation of any urban establishment. New York has had various types of public transit dating all the way back to the 1700’s where the ferry and the horse car were utilized as the norm. In the late 1800s, the rise of the public transit such as the elevated railway and the trolley system allowed New Yorkers to travel to the destination more efficiently. The evolution of the public transit’s technology not only help solved the traffic congestion, but also helped increase the use and evolution of public transit.

						New York City has also been at the forefront of implementing policy that engages the city’s residents with partaking in city development. The New York Consolidated Plan gave everyone a chance to speak out about problems of the city that should be improved. For example, it pointed out that homelessness is the major issue in New York City—ultimately forcing the city government to provide services for them to improve their quality of lives. The Commissioners’ Map in 1811 was the original design plan created to bring physical order to Manhattan, changing it from a disorganized, agricultural mass of farmhouses and swamps to a developed, urbanized grid plan. The Commissioners’ Map also brought forth designated public parks, which met with conflicting interested parties. Furthermore, the New York City Comprehensive Ordinance of 1916 changed the face of planning for New York City and the rest of the United States as a method of placing control on unrestricted growth during a strongly pro-growth time period in the city’s history.

						During the 1800s, New York City consisted of what is modern-day Manhattan and the Bronx.  At the time, Brooklyn consisted of distinct towns that were eventually annexed to the City of Brooklyn, at first the United States’s first commuter suburb and later a powerful twin city to New York. The mid-1850s and 1860s saw the rise of urban development in Brooklyn, with the design of Prospect Park and the major thoroughfares of Eastern and Ocean Parkways. Other municipalities, like Chinatown, were also going through major expansion periods. Chinatown’s high dependence on tourism led to three large scale urban planning with unsuccessful follow-through, as multiple parties and unforgiving circumstances made development in a high estate value area very difficult. Gentrification and the cycle of disinvestment and reinvestment was caused by landlords fishing for investors to seek redevelopment which causes neglect for existing poor tenants, who are much prone to market waves of the rich.

						The 1940s and 1950s saw the rise of Robert Moses. Moses, one of the most revolutionary planners in American history, reshaped the City of New York and the surrounding metropolitan area with his grand megaprojects related to parks, highways, and redevelopment.  Many of these projects were approved because Moses had amassed a large amount of power; in the 1960s, his power diminished, partly due to the successful urban advocacy efforts of Jane Jacobs.

						Future plans for current problems, as within any city, have also been mentioned. Today New York is seen as one of America’s dirtiest cities, but if one could imagine, the streets have had worse odors. New York had no official Sanitation Department until 1881. Before then the streets would fill up with the yesterday’s trash, and even the day’s before that. The Department of Sanitation has evolved since that time and today fewer than 10,000 Sanitation workers keep the streets clean for 8.4 million New Yorkers. Planners of New York today are looking towards the future. Much more emphasis is be made on green and sustainable growth in planning. In Mayor Michael Bloomberg's proposal, PlaNYC, many goals were set to improve the street, buildings and infrastructure of New York to be more environmentally friendly. The New York City of the “tomorrow” is expected to be very sustainable and will see the development of grand projects.  Staten Island is expected to take a larger share of these projects than in previous decades, as Fresh Kills Park (set to be the city’s second largest park), large commercial outlets, and the New York Wheel (set to be the world’s tallest Ferris Wheel) are expected to draw in more economic benefits. Data innovation, within the city, has also provided a more specified scope in determining outlying issues with different city developments such as energy conservation, crime rates, transportation routes, and potential causation correlations. Specifically the use of GIS and topographical mapping developments within the New York City technology departments have given the most in terms of formulating this data advancement.

						New York, as a global city, will always be considered a prominent leader in the Nation’s affairs and influence. Its rich history is extremely vast and significant, and while it is tough to touch upon every major occurrence over the past three centuries, this site looks to pinpoint some of the major developments that have characterized such an impressive city.
