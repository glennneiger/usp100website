						With the loss of the Fresh Kills landfill the Department of Sanitation scrambled to find a new way to dump the people’s trash. Today New Yorkers’ trash is taken from the curb to transfer stations, where once too much trash has built up there is taken to landfills in 6 different states; New Jersey, upstate New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia, and South Carolina. New York streets were once overwhelmed with trash, and even though the city is still seen as one of America’s dirtiest cities, the Department of Sanitation works diligently to make sure the streets of New York are as clean as can be. New York is home to 8.4 residents, and they are served by fewer than 10,000 sanitation workers. The Department of Sanitation carry out three main duties. One, sweeping six thousand miles of street several times a week. Two, collecting 11 tons of trash and 2 thousand tons of recycling. Third, removing snow from the streets. Even though it is a messy job the people and city could fall apart without the hard working employees over at the Sanitation Department. Their work is a necessity if the urban dwellers of New York City would like to stay away vermin and diseases. However as vital as Sanitation workers are they are treated with little to no respect, angrily, and most of the time ignored; the people who first handedly ensure basic health and wellbeing to the citizens. It is ironic that the over 100 years ago the first Sanitation workers were paraded for and cheered on by the citizens of New York, but now are seen nowhere in the same light.
