					<p>
						Through the 1800s there was no proper sanitation systems developed in the streets of New York. Most of New Yorkers at the time would throw their trash out onto the streets. They're trash usually consisted of organic materials that would be consumed by large horses and pigs when thrown onto the streets. The odor from the streets were not the best. Even though New York City is known to have a few peculiar smells today, nothing compared to the odors of the 1800s. All would haul their waste out their windows, however those who could afford it would pay “private collectors” to pick up their trash which they would then dumb in the local rivers. By the 1880s the streets of New York were due for a makeover, and a focus on the sanitation problems needed to be addressed.

						Trash in 1800s, George Waring
					</div>
					<p>
						In 1881 New York established its first independent sanitation agency named the Department of Street Cleaning. They appointed George Waring to be the department’s first commissioner. Warning was a Civil War veteran, and a somewhat of a “sanitary engineer”. With Warning’s military background there was more order and less odor in the city’s streets. The very first employees of the Street Cleaning department wore all-white uniforms with brooms in hand and swept up the streets of New York. The Department asked the people of New York to separate their trash into three categories: food waste that was used to make soap products; garbage; and ash, which there was a lot of due to the fact that people would cook by wood fire. The streets finally had a new look. The drastic change from before and after Waring’s great job as first commission of the Department of Street Cleaning can be seen in this photo. There was even an organized parade for the street cleaning employees where they were cheered for and treated like heroes. Waring accomplished milestones for the city, however he could not accomplish one of his major goals. His goal was to decrease the amount of trash and waste being dumped into the Atlantic Ocean. During the time all waste was dumped into rivers and eventually down to the ocean. Even though Waring pushed hard to eliminate this process, he could not find a workable alternative. Later in 1929 the department got a new name, The Department of Sanitation and the name stuck.
