					<p>
						From the very start, the Hudson was used considerably, as informal ferries were created as soon as residents realized that the river needed to be traversed. What first started was the use of rowboats, which were referred to as “periaugures”. From there on, horseboats, were developed which entailed the use of horses to walk on a treadmill that was connected to the paddle of the boat—essentially using horsepower as energy for the boat. Eventually, this was seen as an important form of transportation, wherein operators began to buy rights to operate ferries throughout different locations of the Hudson.

					<h4 id="sec1">The First Chartered Ferry</h4>
					<p>
						Samuel Bayard was the first to gain a charter in 1700 to create a Ferry that would run along Weehawken, New Jersey, and Manhattan. Although this was considered to be a very rudimentary style of ferry operation, the system lasted for over 10 years. The issue was that the time frame of travel was very problematic and inconsistent. It could take anywhere between 10 minutes all the way to over 3 hours for a simple ride, as the system was heavily dependent on tides and wind factors. The Weehawken operation was on and off for many years, until the it was bought by the New Jersey Midland Railway in 1871. Along with three other railroad companies, the small Weehawken operation became the Weehawken Terminal in 1884. This new terminal had five different ferry and over 15 passenger stations. These served as a prominent demonstration of railroad tandem operated ferries, which created one of the most illustrious operations to ever take part on the Hudson. At one point, specifically in 1926, the ferry had over 26 million riders that went between Manhattan and New Jersey. However, ferry traffic would slowly begin to diminish with the creation of the Holland tunnel, George Washington Bridge, and the Lincoln tunnel which all came to fruition throughout the 1930’s. Eventually a new system developed out of Hoboken, New Jersey, which consequently put the Weehawken route out of business. This Hoboken Ferry lasted fairly well as it was able to stay afloat for over 145 years, until it was closed out in 1967. It was the final official steam ferryboat system run on the Hudson.

					<h4 id="sec1">Current Day Ferry Operations (Staten Island)</h4>
					<p>
						The Staten Island Ferry, currently, remains as the last of any sort of ferry-based transportation systems to run people from Manhattan and its Burroughs. On a daily basis it transports over 70,000 passengers, traveling from St. George on Staten Island and Whitewall Street in lower Manhattan. NYC DOT handles the Staten Island Ferry’s operations, paired with the respective city transport areas and their maritime establishments. This Ferry has been known as an extremely prominent figure within the transportation realm for NYC. It has provided accessible and continuous transportation for decades, and has even come in handy in the face of crises (Transported thousands of people out of Manhattan on 9/11/2001).

					<h4 id="sec1">Future for the Ferry System</h4>
						Currently there has been talk about implementing a new ferry system. Players in the planning process, especially new elected officials, have been advocating for a new ferry system to bolster their transportation track records. Giuliani took the first step, in that he eliminated the ferry fare for the Staten Island Ferry. After the A-train had been destroyed by Hurricane Sandy  in 2012, Bloomberg pushed for ferry services to run from Brooklyn and the Rockaways. Next came De Blasio, who announced that as apart of his new tenure that a new citywide ferry would be put in place---which is set to begin in 2017. The routes would cover areas from the Lower East side up to the Rockaways yet again. The fares plan to mirror that of current prices to ride the subway or bus. Projections have stated that over 4.5 million trips would be made each year using the ferries, which would be overlooked by private operatives. The plan estimates that job creation will foster as a result, paired with the expansion of new commercial centers in the outlying Burroughs. So far, De Blasio’s administration has claimed that they have approved $55 million in funds for this project, and believe that a concurrent $20 million will be needed for operating costs (which does not include possible routes to Coney and Staten Island).
						<br><br>
						Transportation experts and analysts have thrown some caution to the wind for this new undertaking. They have noted that there are large subsidies that ferries need, and may be extraneous considering that there are not really any current issues with limited neighborhood transportation--especially near water. The catch is, that, most people know that the ferry image is apart of the characterization of New York, which makes it hard to refute plans to create such a popularly endorsed entity. It seems that the plan will go onward, despite the uncertainties in its production and route loyalties. The mayor has stressed that as long as some residents will be helped by the new system, then it will be a successful venture.
