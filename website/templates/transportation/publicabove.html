						The first New York City elevated railway was founded in l868 and was power by cable-power. Then in 1871, the elevated railway was replaced by small steam locomotives, which marked the beginning of “The Age of the Els”. It was designed to travel from destination to destination three stories above the ground level, the elevated trains made a great impact to the New Yorkers of they way the live. The Els help people to travel to a longer destination with shorter travel time. Moreover, the stations are spread out all over New York city which allow residents to walk to the station within short distance. By 1880, most of the residents in Manhattan were lived only 10 minutes walk away from the elevated railway stations. By 1903, the elevated rail systems in Brooklyn and Manhattan changed from steam power to electric power in order to provide a quieter, cleaner, smoother, and healthier ride for the passengers. It has made a great impact in many aspects of urban life that we now take for granted. Residents could literally just walk right out of their house and the el’s station is right there. New Yorkers are no longer need to travel a long time just to reach other parts of the city. Elevated trains have brought people together even more from different neighborhoods and backgrounds. People would often complained that the elevated trains were loud, dirty and blocking sunlight, yet they helped people to travel to their destination faster and transformed New York city into a metropolis.
