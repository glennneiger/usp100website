						Commissioners' Map of 1811

						Before the 1800s, there were marshes, mountains and hills all over Manhattan. Roads ran at odd angles and houses were built without order. In 1807, the mayor and Common Council asked the state legislature for permission to lay out a grand plan for the city of the entire Manhattan island, which was approved in 1811. The plan was to build a grid system which runs from Greenwich Village to 155th Street in Washington Heights. The state appointed three commissioners and a surveyor with the task of laying out the city’s future, Gouverneur Morris, a statesman and founding father, Simeon DeWitt, New York State’s surveyor-general, and John Rutherford, former New Jersey senator and respected New York businessman, and John Randel, Jr., their hired surveyor. As a result, the plan gave birth to New York’s famous grid, designed to make it easier for developers to construct “straight-sided and right-angled houses”, and landowners will not have to worry about the city constructing a street right through their property. Thus, the beginning of the plan was to level mountains and filling swamps. Some homeowners, such as a farm house on Broadway and 85th Street, chose to lift and relocate their houses to comply with the right-angled geometry of the grid. However, in most cases, the farm houses and the buildings were simply destroyed. Surveyors also planted hard-to-remove marble monuments at intersections, in which the avenue and street is inscribed into the sides of the monuments, marking the four corners of each block. The Commissioners’ Map of 1811 also set forth a unique street naming style. Many cities before and now had numbered roads in one direction, but having numbered roads in both directions is very unusual. It was because of a very strict enforcement that the influence of the map still dictate the grid system today.

						Public opinion first deemed the grid to be boring, monotonous, profit-centered. Frederick Law Olmsted, an American landscape architect, was strongly against the grid system, saying it was empty architectural, and deprived the city of the possibility of great monuments that distinguished the great cities of Europe, such as the Eiffel Tower in France. However, the surveyor defended his work, saying the plan will facilitate “buying, selling and improving real estate, on streets, avenues, and public squares.” Already, the business-minded path of New York has been paved in the plans. What Olmsted couldn’t envision was the new urban form, which is our current New York City.

					<h4 id="sec1">Influence of Park Planning on City Planning </h4>
					<p>
						The Commissioners’ Map also designated a large land for a park, called the Grand Parade, and multiple smaller parks, and was careful to bring the amount to a minimum, as the commissioners were fully aware of the land constraints. However, since the parks were primarily located on private property and the city would have to purchase the land before these spaces could be allocated, both the landowners and the Common Council was quick to attack it. As a result, an 1814 law significantly shrank the Grant Parade from a 11 by 4 blocks park to 8 by 2 blocks, shrinking by a whopping 60 percent. Further pressure came from persistent landowners who did not want their land to be taken away, and in 1828, the council agreed to petition the state legislature to release the council from purchasing the grounds of the Parade. This was countered by Cornelius, who argued in favor of saving the Parade, by stating three points: the Grand Parade will bring health and well-being of the city, provide a safe place to walk, and for the benefit of future generations. He advocated to middle-class women, who had the most to gain, but was unable to prevent the passing of law in 1829, which removed the Grand Parade from the map.

						In 1823, the Evening Post referred to the scarcity of parks as “one of the greatest blemishes on the face of New York.” With the development of high rises along the coast of New York, the refreshing ocean breeze gradually becomes thinner and thinner the further you go from the coast. Even though New York was coincidentally positioned between a river and an estuary, citizens soon realized that location is not enough. After a cholera outbreak in 1832, the New Yorkers grew fond of the idea that parks provide a way to counter polluted and disease-ridden air. What gave the final push in advocating for parks, was the jealousy and insecurity developed by local citizens as they noticed more and more immigrants moving in and an increasing number of non-locals becoming wealthy. The parks could help the locals because of the benefit they brought to real estate values, and the parks have the power to attract wealthy individuals and raise the city’s tax revenue. As a result, countless proposals was submitted to the council, seeking funds for improvement of their local neighborhood.
						<br><br>
						However, the new parks did not benefit the New Yorkers equally. Most of the funding structure implemented by the government only sought to improve wealthy neighborhoods and in new housing developments designed for wealthy purchasers. The park promoters at the time was only concerned with creating exclusive, elite spaces that would bolster real estate prices and the city’s tax revenue. As a result, places like the House of Refuge, located at the intersection of Broadway, Fifth Avenue and 24th Street, an institution for juvenile delinquents, were deemed to bring down the property value of the neighborhood. Given that the local residents were willing to pay for the removal of the institution, the Committee approved the plan in 1837, and built the Madison Square.
