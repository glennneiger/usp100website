					<h4 id="sec1">Robert Moses and the “Demonstration of Blight”</h4>
					<p>
						Perhaps the most noticeable changes to have taken place in modern New York City have come from the work of Robert Moses, an urban planner who became one of the most powerful authority figures in New York at the peak of this career.  In the 1950s, Moses led a slum-clearing program, advertised in published photographed brochures, that attempted to justify the redevelopment of his targeted locations.  It became the largest slum clearance program in the United States; in total, 35 projects were planned under the program and 17 were completed.  
						<br><br>
						The slum clearance program became very controversial, in particular for its subjective nature.  (Moses assumed that people would be led to the same conclusions to which he came when viewing the brochure photographs)  Problems mainly arose from people’s different interpretations of the brochure photographs; some people felt that many of the photographs presented neighborhoods set for redevelopment that were not in poor condition.  Furthermore, because Title I of the United States Housing Act of 1949, which provided subsidies from the federal government for slum clearance, did not have a definition of slum, Moses was able to apply his policies liberally.  This resulted in his choosing to target areas that he felt would attract sponsors for redevelopment, rather than areas truly in need of redevelopment; as a result, the vast majority of projects were concentrated in Manhattan, where development is most densely concentrated, rather than in some areas in other boroughs that had worse conditions.  The slum clearance program left behind a mixed legacy, as it did not work as efficiently as it should have but also led to the institution of a more efficient redevelopment team by Mayor Robert Wagner.

					<h4 id="sec1">Robert Moses and the Transformation of New York</h4>
					<p>   
						Robert Moses is said to be the most powerful and influential planner in New York City’s history.  As a man who amassed a large amount of power in his career, Moses often directed his power toward increasing access to the city via automobile through the development of bridges and highways and toward the creation of usable parkland.  Throughout his career, he held an impressive résumé of positions, which included the following:
						<ul>
							<li>President, Long Island State Parks Commission, 1924-1963</li>
							<li>Chairman, NY State Council of Parks, 1924-1963</li>
							<li>Secretary of State, New York State, 1927-1928</li>
							<li>President, Jones Beach Parkway Authority, 1933-1963</li>
							<li>President, Bethpage State Park Authority, 1933-1963</li>
							<li>Chairman, Emergency Public Works Commission, 1933-34</li>
							<li>Commissioner, NYC Department of Parks, 1934-1960</li>
							<li>Chairman, Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, 1934-1981</li>
							<li>NYC Planning Commissioner, 1946-1960</li>
							<li>Chairman, New York State Power Authority, 1954-1962</li>
							<li>President, New York’s World Fair, 1960-1966</li>
							<li>Special Advisor to the Governor of New York State on Housing, 1974- 1975</li>
						</ul>
						Among the many projects he initiated, some of the most notable New York City projects include the following:
						<ul>
							<li>Triborough Bridge</li>
							<li>Queens Midtown Tunnel</li>
							<li>Bronx Whitestone Bridge</li>
							<li>Brooklyn Battery Tunnel</li>
							<li>Throg’s Neck Bridge</li>
							<li>Verrazano-Narrows Bridge</li>
							<li>Westside Highway</li>
						</ul>

					<h4 id="sec1">Jane Jacobs: Opposition to Robert Moses</h4>
					<p>
						In his method of developing large projects, Moses gained notoriety for his large-scale clearance style of development, which stands in contrast to organic city growth.  One notable contemporary who opposed his projects was Jane Jacobs, who attempted to illustrate the problem with Moses’s style of development.  Although she had no formal planning experience, her advocacy for the preservation of older buildings and urban neighborhoods notable played a role in the stoppage of three of Moses’s plans.  The first was the building of a four-lane highway through Washington Square Park, the second, one of Moses’s redevelopment projects that did not pass, would have claimed fourteen blocks of Greenwich Village (where Jacobs lived until she moved to Toronto in 1968) for redevelopment, and the third was a plan to create a ten-lane highway, which would have been called the Lower Manhattan Expressway, through SoHo, Little Italy, Chinatown and the Lower East Side.
