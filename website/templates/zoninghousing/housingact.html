						The Housing Act of 1949 was approved by the President Truman after WWII, and this act was considered as the landmark in the American history because it aimed to made homes more affordable for many low-income families. President Truman said that the act “opens up the new foreground of affordable houses for poor families.”
						<br><br>
						The main contents of the Act are:
						<ol>
							<li> Encouraging the Federal Housing Administration to provide rural homeowners with financial help.</li>
							<li>Increasing federal money to construct over 800,000 public houses.</li>
							<li>Funding researches in housing techniques</li>
							<li>Starting slum clearance programs and urban renewal projects</li>
							<li>Authorizing Federal Housing Administration to increase mortgage insurance</li>
						</ol>
						The Housing Act also had a deep influence on the New York City. After the victory of the WWII, many soldiers came back from the battlefield, thus the rapid growth of population increasing the demand for housing. However, the housing price in the city was really high that many low-income families could not afford. So many families moved to the suburbs. It turned out that some rich families most white people lived in the Manhattan while other poor families moved to the suburbs, which caused the racial segregation. With the increase of people moving to the suburbs and also the rapid economic growth of rural areas, the downtown city began to decline. The federal government noticed this problem and also it tried to follow the funding promise that people were born equally. The Housing Act was made not only to guarantee people’s equal rights of having affordable houses, but also it wanted to make the downtown city revive. However, to achieve these two goals, many critics believed that there were more to be done besides the implement of the Housing Act.
