					<p>
						Up until the early 20th century, the Lower East Side of New York purged of ethnicity. Even when the war ended and the adults of parents who remained in this “old neighborhood” never returned home, the Lower East Side still faced a large influx of immigrants, from the original Irish to the Germans, who, in turn, were replaced by Italians and Jews. However, when the Congress greatly reduced immigration in the 1920s, the population in the Lower East Side began to slide, vacancies piled up and forced landlords to adopt new policies in order to prevent foreclosure. Landlords at first sought to modernize the neighborhoods in order to attract middle-income households, but the government funding policies focused on constructing low-income housing instead. 
						<br><br>
						By 1950s, the Lower East Side still remained the slums. Even though there was a temporary influx of Puerto Ricans, the Puerto Ricans were cut short by the shifting economy of New York. At the beginning of the 19th century, the Lower East Side served as a dormitory for blue-collared workers whose main trade was physical labor. However, the economy restructured in the 1950s toward the business sector, and when the real estate investors discovered that the profits to be made from reinventing the slums were non-existent, they responded by cutting all investments into the Lower East Side. As a result, the Lower East Side experienced widespread housing abandonment in the 1970s.

					<h4 id="sec1">From Disinvestment to Reinvestment and the Frontier Line</h4>
					<p>
						Gentrification, or the process of renewing and rebuilding deteriorated urban property by middle-class or affluent people, usually results in displacements of lower-income people. This usually happens in two steps: disinvestment, or the relative withdrawal of any form of capital from any type of construction, and reinvestment, the return of capital to landscapes and building structures previous experiencing disinvestment. In a way, we can envision the division of the structures experiencing disinvestment and reinvestment by a “frontier line,” such that structures ahead of the frontier line will still be experiencing disinvestment and devalorization, or the process in which bankers, realtors, and other profit driven stakeholders emphasize long-term profit and drive down the values of the assets. The structures behind the frontier line, on the other hand, will be receiving some form of reinvestment to offset the disinvestment.
						<br><br>
						Disinvestment comes from the decisions by owners, landlords, local and national governments, and an array of financial institutions. These people represent a large stake in the direction of where the flow of capitals will be adjusted towards, in which these people will also have the profits of other neighborhoods in their minds as well. As Anthony Downs, an American economist specializing in public policy and public administration, says, “a certain amount of neighborhood deterioration is an essential part of urban development.” The ultimate rationale for geographically selective disinvestment is to restrict the effects of devalorization, economic decline and asset loss to nearby neighborhoods, and thereby protecting the integrity of mortgage loans in other areas. The disinvestment will lead to an increasing exploitation of the land owner on the property, resulting in termination of debt service, insurance, property taxes, and performance of maintenance and repairs, and the provision of vital resources such as elevators, water and heat. The property will also be changed hands many times, and the “finisher” will perform the final gutting of the building’s economic value, such as removing fixtures and putting furniture up for sale. The long term reasoning of such a depressing path to take, is that a low market value building is a necessary if not sufficient condition for the onset of gentrification, and thus reinvestment.

					<h4 id="sec1">The Gentrification in Alphabet City</h4>
					<p>
						In the 1980s, The East Village went through a series of real estate investors, such that at successive stages, capital came from different sources with different intentions as different playmakers entered and exited the investment game. Nonetheless, if profits were to be made in the local real estate, then developers had to circumvent multiple legal, economic and social barriers already in place.
						<br><br>
						A biggest factor which prevented a conversion of the East Village into a high-rent district were the laws regulating rent levels. Many of the residents are protected by state-legislated rent controls and renewable leases, protecting financially vulnerable populations, especially new immigrants, as the East Village was once reliant on the flow of overseas labor. The rent control also allows for control over gentrification pressures, protecting the houses of those who may be forcibly evicted. The laws which cover rent control and rent stability were the Emergency Tenant Protection Act of 1974 (EPTA) and the Rent Stabilization Law of 1969 (RSL). As a result, a typical 18-unit walk-up apartment in the Alphabet City had a wide gap in rent payment, ranging from low-income households protected by state laws living side by side with higher-income whites who pay much more. A building on Seventh Street between Avenues B and C had rents ranging from $250 to $835 on the same floor, with the only difference being the more expensive one to be recently-renovated. By law, landlords may increase the rent of rent-regulated units after they have been vacated and structurally improved, so in order to reap higher rent benefits, the landlord must either pay a fine of $10,000 for eviction, or resort to unorthodox treatment.
						<br><br>
						A specific example of unfair treatment is Ramon Hernandez, who was awarded $112,000 from the state after he realized his landlord overcharged him more than $1,000 per month, at 701 Saint Nicholas Avenue. He was charged $1,300 per month, but because of broken doors, windows, rat issues, holes in the kitchen floor, the state froze the rent at $233 until the landlord resolved the issues.
