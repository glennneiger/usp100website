						In 1916, New York City enacted the United States’s first comprehensive zoning laws. The laws separated land uses by housing, commercial, industrial districts and also created a typology of five height districts as ratios of street width and five area districts with different minima and maxima sizes as percentages of lots. (It should be noted that at the time of the laws’ implementation, New York City did not explicitly create a single-family residential housing district, as it was seen as an “anti-growth” measure that was not seen as favorable; the lack of such a housing district led to higher densities than intended in some neighborhoods in the five boroughs) The laws were created by New York City’s Commission on Building Heights and Restrictions and Committee on Building Heights in response to real estate and business owners who felt uncontrolled development was adversely affecting their property values. Examples of supposed adverse effects from the points of view of property owners were large developments’ blocking sunlight and the dropping of rent prices from the surge in leasable space, allowing for a mix of lower and higher-class establishments. (The latter complaint came particularly from upscale tenants located along Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan) The lack of zoning laws prior to 1916 had also given rise to complaints from homeowners primarily in Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island, who saw the construction of large apartment complexes in areas primarily composed of houses as contributing to social problems and “undermined the ability of residents to see their houses as homes, as havens of peace and stability.” [2] Today, the 1916 Zoning Resolution is significant primarily for spreading the practice of zoning throughout the United States. In retrospect, the ordinance did not ease congestion in areas of the city or increases quality of life in areas that had already experienced uncontrolled development (particularly in Manhattan), although it was able to reduce unrestricted growth outside of Manhattan in less-developed areas.
