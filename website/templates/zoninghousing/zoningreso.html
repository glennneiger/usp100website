						New York City was one of the major cities in the nation and there were many unique plans set for the City. However, with the rapid growth of populations, the planning principles of the 1916 document can no longer fit to the changing of the environment in New York City. The population of New York City had already over 55 million people at that time and this was beyond the city’s maximum capacity. Therefore, new urban planning was a necessity for New York City. When thinking about new ideas, planners needed to take measures to issues that were brought by the appearance of automobiles. The use of automobiles had brought much convenience to the native citizens but more vacant areas were needed as the parking spaces for this new type of transportation. Based on all the factors above, it was very obvious that the 1916 document should be amended and a new planning was needed. After long-time research and study, the Zoning Resolution was took effect in 1961. Even if the Zoning Resolution indeed solved many problems during time, it still had some disadvantages. One core idea of the Zoning Resolution was the emphasis on the open spaces. The Zoning Resolution decreased the residential densities, especially the edges of the city. However, the increase of the open spaces caused buildings out of scale with the surroundings. Also, the open space was not very useful seeing from today.

						The concept, Zoning, refers to the legislative method of controlling the use of all the land in a municipality by regulating use. The Zoning Resolution in New York City was country’s first comprehensive zoning resolution and there were three categories of use of districts: residential, commercial, and unrestricted districts. In order to illustrate the location of distinct places, ordinance maps were used. The 1961 Zoning Resolution was created to fit the economy and the rapid growth of population. The Zoning Resolution was very successful and was seen as a setback for planning and has very deep influences today.
